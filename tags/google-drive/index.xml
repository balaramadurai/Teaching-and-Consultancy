      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://balaramadurai.net/blog/2012/05/09/dropbox-for-nokia-simplify-your-nokia-life/&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, I have been looking around for suggestions and tools on syncing google drive and dropbox. SkyDrive offers 25GB, so I thought, why the hassle of maintaining so many of these. The problem statement is that of - How can I have just one copy of my files, but have so many services backing up my files. Right now, all I have is about 5GB of stuff&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One suggestion was to place Dropbox folder inside Google Drive or the other way around. I tried it out, but I got a &amp;ldquo;System Folder&amp;rdquo; error. So I tried the other way around of placing Google Drive Folder inside Dropbox and it worked. Now add SkyDrive into the equation. Make SkyDrive folder as the master folder under which you have Dropbox which contains Google Drive. Do you want to make your virtual life even more difficult, throw SugarSync into the fray. All SugarSync needs is a file location and it backs up your computer contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;img/image.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/image.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the various steps if you were to start from scratch?
1. Install &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.live.com/&#34;&gt;SkyDrive app&lt;/a&gt; first (Leave the recommended settings as is)
2. Install Dropbox app next and select advanced settings to select the folder. (Choose the SkyDrive folder)
3. Install Google Drive app and choose Dropbox folder as your install folder.
4. Install SugarSync app and select the SkyDrive folder for syncing (You can actually choose any of the cloud drives)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of the nested cloud&lt;/strong&gt;
1. Never bother about individually syncing each of your cloud services
2. Each cloud drive has several backups of your version
3. Google Drive and SkyDrive let you create documents on the move
4. Dropbox and Picasa lets you upload pictures from your camera and is easy to share as well. (Dropbox upgrades your folder space when you upload pictures from your camera, 500MB at a time)
5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of the nested cloud&lt;/strong&gt;
1. 5GB is all you get for free (since that is the lowest common denominator of the services)
2. You are losing out on cumulative storage (Dropbox - 2GB (default), SkyDrive - 7GB, Google Drive - 5GB, SugarSync - 5GB, Total - 19GB, with referrals and tricks, you can reach 40GB of distributed cloud space)
3. 4 syncing apps on your desktop can slow your computer down considerably
4. Multi-computer sync can be messy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I really like my nested cloud setup. My recommendation is that people who want it all, but want minimum hassles, please adopt the above mentioned method, else you can also try services like &lt;a href=&#34;http://zeropc.com&#34;&gt;zeropc.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dropbox for Nokia - Simplify your Nokia Life!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After several weeks of search for a decent app for Dropbox (storage for the cloud) on my outdated, outclassed, neglected Symbian Nokia E52 smartphone (Yes, fellas, it is a smartphone, even though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have Android or iOS on it), I hit upon the right solution. Ok, let me backtrack a bit and describe to you my system of storage and how I want to carry my world with me- &lt;a href=&#34;http://balaramadurai.net/blog/2011/11/22/3-steps-to-store-and-access-anything-anywhere/&#34;&gt;Here it is&lt;/a&gt;. What I have now is my &amp;ldquo;smartphone&amp;rdquo; doubling up as my USB device, since I thought that if I had a reliable Nokia Dropbox app, that would make syncing a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/dropbox.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://store.ovi.com/content/125322&#34;&gt;Dropian&lt;/a&gt; was where I started out. Nice interface, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t preserve the folder structure when you download files. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tlehto.net/Drops60/help.html&#34;&gt;Drops60&lt;/a&gt; worked well in preserving the folder structure but has one limitation (and apparently, it is a limitation that the Dropbox API imposes) that the app cannot do a directory/folder recursion while syncing. So, you have to manually browse to every folder to sync everything. Bummer!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want is for all the folders that are on my dropbox folder to be present on my Nokia phone. Then, I started looking for a portable Dropbox
application that will run once I stick my phone into the desktop as a memory device (2nd best option to recursive syncing, but hey it works!). I found
&lt;a href=&#34;http://nionsoftware.com/dbpahk/download&#34;&gt;DropboxPortableAHK&lt;/a&gt; as the answer. Once you go thru the wizard and installation on your storage device, the
portable dropbox actually runs as a different instance of Dropbox desktop app and syncs with your USB device. I gave it a different color (Yes, you
can configure different colors for different USB devices).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/systray-dropbox.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;systray dropbox&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, my digital/portable life is split into - creation and storage. Creation happens using Google Drive and storage using dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next search is for syncing dropbox and google drive or a portable sync for Google Drive! Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
