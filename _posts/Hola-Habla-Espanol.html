"Hola! Habla espanol?"
</p>

<p>
The pinnacle of my Spanish speaking career came in Barcelona. The Spouse and I were holidaying with our meticulously laid out plan to tour around Europe. We landed up 2 hours before the expected arrival time in Barca railway station. We were to go to Cerbère on the Spain-France border. A connecting train was to be waiting across the border to take us to Marseille. We waited for nearly 1 hour and 57 minutes to know which platform our train was to arrive. When we did get to know, we ran downstairs.

Yes, the train platforms were in the basement. The handle of my stroller broke, never minding that, I hauled it across and double staired to reach the platform. The Spouse was still a way off, but I thought a foot in the door will help me. I looked left, there was a train parked. I looked right, there was another train parked. All on the same platform. Darn it! Then I heard a warning tone, which we were used to by now in Europe. All trains give a warning tone before doors close. Then I noticed the words “Cerbère” written on the train started to move really rapidly away from us. The Spouse and I came back to the main platform totally fuming. We took comfort in the fact that there were others who missed the train as well. In particular, there was this lady, who rattled off in Spanish and was looking at us for some empathy. We could feel that and I, in particular felt another heat wave. This time from The Spouse – “Why don’t you run around and fix this mess?” was the message frequency modulated with the heat wave. (Please refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation</a> ).
“How could I manage a conversation with a lady who doesn’t know any English? I hope she helps me out with this” were the thoughts racing through my head.

“Hola! Habla español?” was all I could muster from my Spanish lessons for now. The lady turned around quite amused, since she was talking to another person at the time. I knew I had grabbed her attention and that I just had to stick around her to get our way out of this mess. Then the lady and I moved to the ticket counter, who promptly directed us to another important looking person. The important looking person shook her head and wrote something on our tickets. Then, we were waiting for another Cerbere bound train due in another 2 1/2 hours. Another dreadful wait and this time, the Colombian lady and I (did I tell you I found out that she was Colombian ?) were scurrying between our seats and the ticket counter to find out the platform number. This time, the platform number was announced about 10 minutes ahead of time in Spanish and English! I must have made quite an impression with my broken Spanish.

The train arrived on the right platform and we all hopped in. Train? What train? It was 3 coaches long. C’mon, we call it track inspection vehicle in India if the train is anything less than 22 coaches long.. :) We got off at Cerbere, got our passports examined and boarded another train. The Colombian, her dog, The Spouse and I were in the same coach. I had about 2 hours to construct Spanish sentences in my head about what I do, where did we learn Spanish, etc. There were 4 hours left for us to reach Marseille. We struck a good conversation and to our surprise, the lady knew Yogic concepts like Kundalini, breathing control and what not. She even demonstrated to us some Yoga postures. All this while, instructing her to dog to sit quiet. In return, I told her about my company, GE, back then, about how we made windmills (she filled in for our missing vocabulary), jet engines and the likes. She spoke slowly and corrected my grammar (I could never for the life of me keep in my head which object was feminine and which object was masculine). She appreciated our Argentinian accent and about how foreigners get the “R” wrong. She was taking her dog all the way from Colombia to her daughter in Montpellier in France, so that she has some company there. The things mothers do for their daughters. I enquired about her country and told her about the image we have of Colombia through Hollywood. She was unhappy the way natural resources in her country were depleted for all the wrong motives.
Then came the time for us to say good bye. She grabbed the dog in one hand, whisked away her big backpack and turned around to bid us farewell. “Good bye, Thanks for all the help and support and the amazing company you guys gave me” in pure, unadulterated English, were her parting words.
