"Yo Bala! over here!"
</p>

<p>
My friend from the US was visiting our lab. This was John’s first trip outside of the US of A. He had a highly successful project running for years with distributed teams in China and India. He had not met any of them and wanted to visit the teams and catch a glimpse of the world outside of USA. He visited the team in China before he screeched his way to India.

I had finished my appraisal, so there wasn’t much work for a scientist after he finished writing his yearly appraisal. We would all wait for our next year’s funding to arrive before we could start work on our project. Consider it a scientist’s “bench” time, a corporate scientist, that is. Since, I had a lot of time at hand, I put my hand up to take John around Bangalore, the moment my manager put the task up for volunteers.

A Ford Ikon with full blast A/C was commanded for the foreign visitor. John turned out to be an atypical American tourist, atleast contrary to my expectations. He stopped to eat panipuris, cut fruits were fine with him and he drank “tap water”. The pseudo-American in me had stomach cramps just seeing all this unfold in front of my eyes. I asked him about his kids, his trip to Shanghai and everything under the sun.
He didn’t take out a camera and did not stare at cows crossing the street. My eyebrows were permanently raised throughout the sightseeing trip. The pinnacle came in Brigade Road. For those of you, who don’t know about Brigade Road, think of the most crowded road in the world, which has a ton of cars moving and multiply it by a factor of 2. (Chennaites, Ranganathan Street doesnot have cars going thru it :-p). There is very little respite for pedestrians, since either the cars are busy parking or zipping past the Road. I happened to be a very careful road-crosser, even if it is jaywalking, do it carefully. I was looking left, right, centre and took my own sweet time to analyze road conditions. I looked to my left to check if John had his eyes closed to avoid looking at the horrific traffic on road. To my shock, I couldn’t find John. I looked left, right, nope, not there. No mobiles with me either. I heard a faint call “Yo Bala! over here!”. I looked straight ahead in the direction of where the voice came from. John had already crossed the road.
Another 3 minutes later, I joined him across the road, still with my eyebrows stuck where they were. I couldn’t explain this one, so the scientist in me took control of me and grilled him. “John, you are supposed to be an American. You are supposed to be afraid of Indian traffic and totally inadept at crossing Indian roads. Please, please explain”. John patiently explained to me. “I was in Shanghai before coming to Bangalore. I was terrified of crossing the road, waiting for the opportune moment to cross the road. My hostess had crossed, seeing me, she crossed the road one more time to come up to me. She explained that to cross a road in Shanghai, the first step is to let go of the curb. The traffic shapes around you and you move to your destination. So, I assumed Bangalore is no different from Shanghai and crossed the road without a problem”.

That hit me so hard. “Let go of the curb” – as simple as that. To reach one’s goal, one had to let go off the current situation so that one can embark on to something new. I was waiting for opportunities to come to me, while all I needed to do was to just let go. So here I am in the free world, having let go of my material “scienticisms”. The world shaped around me to accommodate me. John, wherever you are, I’ll remember you for this high spiritual advice.
