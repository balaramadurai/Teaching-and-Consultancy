<p>
What do budding industrial designers, a professor in industrial design, couple of material scientists and an entrepreneur have in common? A thirst for novelty and the desire to help people. The venue was perfect with movable chairs, a whiteboard, projector, an audio system, just in case, we lost our ability to shout. Ranjan had arranged for flipcharts, markers and motivators. Motivators are little chocolate blocks, which go a long way in crafting excellent design from anyone. Shankar(LinkedIn, Twitter), the lead facilitator, started off with a brief introduction on what innovation is.
</p>


<p>
“Bringing insightful ideas into a market”
</p>

<p>
This tweet like mantra is all there is.
</p>

<p>
There are 3 stages of !nnovation flow –
</p>

<p>
Focus
Escape &amp; Align
Move
Focus is the step where the entire attention is on “where the heck is the problem?”
</p>

<p>
Escape &amp; Align is about “What all can solve this problem?” “Are my ideas science fiction or are they aligned to my organization/customers?”
</p>

<p>
Move is about “How do take it from here into the future?”
</p>

<p>
Bala(LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook) laid out the plan for the workshop.
</p>

<p>
Problem selection &amp; team formation Focus: 9 questions, Logo, Ideal Final Result, 5-Whys, function mapping Escape&amp;Align: SCAMPER&amp;IFR, Visual Business Model Move: Wasn’t covered as part of this workshop
</p>

<p>
Sridhar(LinkedIn, Twitter) gave an overview of Thatva which was a big part of the workshop as it gave a workspace for the teams to work out their ideas. The Thatva tool guided the teams to formalize their plans.
</p>

<p>
6 ladies were appointed team captains and was asked to form their own teams of 4 members. There was intense chaos, but resulted in naturally formed cohesive teams.
</p>

<p>
Task 1: Pick a socially relevant problem to solve and name your team.
</p>

<p>
Task 2: Draw a good logo for your team
</p>

<p>
All logos are given below. Their logo pretty much depicts their problem statement as well. A fun way to focus, we thought.
</p>

<p>
Logos
</p>

<p>
Logo that made us facilitators worry about the sanity of the team
</p>



<p>
Whacky team, and a creative one!
</p>

<p>
Logo that made us cry
</p>



<p>
Democracy at work, this team, everyone was listened to, well, almost everyone ;-)
</p>

<p>
Logo that went thru more revisions than the colours on their logo
</p>



<p>
When you lack content, use colour :-)
</p>

<p>
Logo that was corny
</p>



<p>
Tagline says it all
</p>

<p>
Logo that had one guy do all the work
</p>



<p>
New Leaf and newleafers leafing new leafs
</p>



<p>
H3O – the logo that required a long winded explanation
</p>

<p>
Ideal Final Result and Incubation
</p>

<p>
Once the slogans, logo, initial discussions were over, ’twas analysis time. Top 3 benefits, 3 deficiencies, 3 dollar costs of the current situation was analyzed. 5-whys applied to find root cause of the problems, rather than stop at the first instance of trouble. The budding designers really liked the simplicity of the tool and the impact that the tool left.
</p>



<p>
The smiling Prof. Chakrabarti
</p>

<p>
Incubation Time: The teams had to draw in pictures their problem with a funny restriction – No Words! SIPOC or supplier, inputs, process, output and customer was used as a template for the function mapping. This was given as overnight assignment.
</p>

<p>
Day 1 drew to a closure. We had promised a day of hardwork and so it was, big grind.
</p>

<p>
Day 2 started with Sridhar guiding the teams to enter their output into Thatva and some basics on business plans.
</p>

<p>
Today was fun day – Started with silent brainstorming – Write down all ideas that pop in to your head to solve the problem as illustrated in the various tools of Focus. As much as 30 ideas emerged per team. Guided ideation – SCAMPER or substitute, combine, adapt, minimize/maximize, put to other use, eliminate, reverse was put to use. The teams found SCAMP quite good and added more ideas to their kitty. For Adapt, role play was used. Questions like “What would Superman do [if he were to solve your problem]?” not only sent out giggles around the room, but some unheard of ideas. Eliminate and Reverse were the toughest ones for the participants. Some really good ideas emerged for teams who persisted with their thinking.
</p>

<p>
What does a team with a lot of ideas do? Giggle, snicker, doze and merge ideas into a concept. A concept chart was drawn out of all or most ideas during the session. This was presented amidst some power outages as seen in the pictures. Nothing stops enthusiastic students from presenting their ideas.
</p>

<p>
This ended a great 2 half days for all of us. The students didn’t realize that they had taught the facilitators a great deal more than what was expected. A grand gala lunch followed in Nesara restaurant in IISc, Bangalore. We were richer by a few more facebook friends! Of course, a big thanks to Prof. Amaresh Chakrabarti and all his enthusiastic students who gave us the opportunity.

“Baaammmm…” was the huge noise that was heard when our car hit a black SX-4 while zigzagging in Chennai traffic. This happened a few years ago near a Chennai suburb called Padi. I was acting consultant to a large car component manufacturer. Alongside with me was a professor of mine who was also consulting with this company. He had invited me to give a talk to a bunch of trainee engineers and senior management.
</p>


<p>
An hour ago…
</p>

<p>
Prof O and me had a long journey from Adyar to Padi, residential southern end of Chennai to the north-western industrial end of Chennai. We were chitchatting on the intricacies of my world and his world. All along, a black sedan was “driving like crazy” in the corner of my eye. Our driver, Raju, had actually revved up a few times. Since, prof O and I were so lost in our conversation, neither of us paid attention, since I had a job at hand of convincing the management about the limitations of their instrument.
</p>

<p>
Just before a traffic signal, the black sedan suddenly cut across and Raju lost it. Prof O and I were still deep in scientific conversation. Raju’s feet slammed the brakes and he moaned and looked at his rear view mirror to see if we had noticed. This is
when I noticed that there was something amiss and I remarked it to the professor. Before, he could say anything, the black sedan
zipped past us and Raju revved up and in 3 seconds, he not only caught up with the sedan, also cut across. Raju had misjudged the maneuver and “Baaaammm”, ended damaging the black sedan. Both vehicles stopped. The driver of the black sedan stepped out, a young gentleman about 25-30 years old, medium build and dressed in a safari suit.
</p>

<p>
“Enna saaar?” quizzed the sedan driver with his thumbs up, a typical “what’s up” of Chennai. I thought that was a typical Tamil gesture of asking a question. He was seething with anger and looked at us. Prof O shrugged his shoulders and said in English “We are consultants, we have nothing to do with this car”. The attention now shifted to Raju, who was aghast at what he had done. What followed was shocking… Raju unfastened his seatbelt and stepped out of the car and was about to examine the damage. The sedan driver slapped Raju on his face with his right hand and uttered words that I can’t write here. Raju didn’t say a word. We expected retaliation or war of words from Raju. Nothing! He stood his ground and quietly told the sedan driver that he was
sorry for the behaviour and promised to pay up for the damages.
</p>

<p>
20 minutes of negotiation with the driver at a distance from us and Raju got back into the car. No microscopy or materials science talk after that, it was just the filtered traffic noise and the hum of the A/C. We reached our destination and got out of the car.
</p>

<p>
My session went well and the management seemed happy with my analysis of their instrument and we were ready to return. We were waiting for Raju and his car. Raju came by walk and was his usual smiling self. Prof O asked him about the morning’s events. Raju admitted that the sedan’s movements pulled him into an unnecessary dual, which resulted in the damage of the sedan.
</p>

<p>
“Everything’s even now”, said Raju.
</p>

<p>
“What do you mean?” asked a surprised Prof.
</p>

<p>
“Narasimha is a courier person to our company and he has been late in bringing his shipments on 3-4 occasions and owes us money. So we settled with him and we are no longer continuing business with him”
</p>

<p>
“Who is Narasimha?”
</p>

<p>
“The driver who hit us, saar. He is Narasimha and I am in-charge of handling couriers in this company from now on” smiled Raju… “He shouldn’t have slapped me, saar. That is why he is paying for this”.

<p>
Have you gone to a high profile presentation only to discover that your latest version is in your home computer or office desktop?Have you ever wished that you didn’t have to carry your laptop anywhere?
</p>

<p>
Have you ever wanted to travel totally light, say carrying a pendrive and you lost the device?
Have you felt the need for your presentation software in a conference or in a client location?
</p>

<p>
If your answer is yes to any one of the questions above, you will be able to relate to my experiences.
</p>


<p>
My selection criteria was simple: portable, light (physically) and I shouldn’t be bothered with backing up or maintaining. And of course, investments should be, well, zero. I don’t prefer to carry music or videos with me, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Required:
USB pendrive of atleast 2GB capacity
</p>

<p>
One primary computer – desktop or laptop
</p>

<p>
1 Signup on Dropbox for free 2GB space (Note- You can also add more space by doing certain steps as described in Dropbox)
</p>


<p>
or
If you want more free space (5GB), sugarsync is a good alternative.
SugarSync logo
2 Download Portable apps platform with any applications from portableapps.com on your pendrive
</p>

<p>
LibreOffice for Office apps
Chrome browser for browsing
DSynchronize for synchronizing Pendrive and Dropbox/Sugarsync (with realtime sync)
VUE for intuitive presentations (I copied the ProgramFilesVUE files and is now portable)
Lyx for WYSIWYG LaTeX editing
Zotero Standalone for storing research citations (works well with Chrome’s Zotero plug-in)
Skype (just in case, there is no skype on a machine I login)
3 Install dropbox app (or sugarsync desktop app) on your computer and designate a folder inside the Dropbox folder as Pendrive.
</p>


<p>
Now, there are apps in portable apps to secure all files, folders and settings using a password. As luck would have it, I was invited to give a talk and I wanted to give a presentation using VUE and not powerpoint. I popped in my USB pendrive into the presentation machine, opened VUE from there and in less than a minute, I was ready to present without any hitches.
</p>

<p>
The other day, I forgot to take my USB pendrive to a workshop, I was facilitating. No problem, I had sugarsync on my mobile device to retrieve all required files and apps. Oh yes, one could avoid the USB drive altogether with an app running on a mobile device, but that is a choice I leave it to you.
</p>

<p>
Happy wireless and careless life :-)
</p>

<p>
Later, I will write about Skydrive, GMailDrive

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The pinnacle of my Spanish speaking career came in Barcelona. The Spouse and I were holidaying with our meticulously laid out plan to tour around Europe. We landed up 2 hours before the expected arrival time in Barca railway station. We were to go to Cerbère on the Spain-France border. A connecting train was to be waiting across the border to take us to Marseille. We waited for nearly 1 hour and 57 minutes to know which platform our train was to arrive. When we did get to know, we ran downstairs.
</p>


<p>
Yes, the train platforms were in the basement. The handle of my stroller broke, never minding that, I hauled it across and double staired to reach the platform. The Spouse was still a way off, but I thought a foot in the door will help me. I looked left, there was a train parked. I looked right, there was another train parked. All on the same platform. Darn it! Then I heard a warning tone, which we were used to by now in Europe. All trains give a warning tone before doors close. Then I noticed the words “Cerbère” written on the train started to move really rapidly away from us. The Spouse and I came back to the main platform totally fuming. We took comfort in the fact that there were others who missed the train as well. In particular, there was this lady, who rattled off in Spanish and was looking at us for some empathy. We could feel that and I, in particular felt another heat wave. This time from The Spouse – “Why don’t you run around and fix this mess?” was the message frequency modulated with the heat wave. (Please refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation</a> ).
“How could I manage a conversation with a lady who doesn’t know any English? I hope she helps me out with this” were the thoughts racing through my head.
</p>

<p>
“Hola! Habla español?” was all I could muster from my Spanish lessons for now. The lady turned around quite amused, since she was talking to another person at the time. I knew I had grabbed her attention and that I just had to stick around her to get our way out of this mess. Then the lady and I moved to the ticket counter, who promptly directed us to another important looking person. The important looking person shook her head and wrote something on our tickets. Then, we were waiting for another Cerbere bound train due in another 2 1/2 hours. Another dreadful wait and this time, the Colombian lady and I (did I tell you I found out that she was Colombian ?) were scurrying between our seats and the ticket counter to find out the platform number. This time, the platform number was announced about 10 minutes ahead of time in Spanish and English! I must have made quite an impression with my broken Spanish.
</p>


<p>
The train arrived on the right platform and we all hopped in. Train? What train? It was 3 coaches long. C’mon, we call it track inspection vehicle in India if the train is anything less than 22 coaches long.. :) We got off at Cerbere, got our passports examined and boarded another train. The Colombian, her dog, The Spouse and I were in the same coach. I had about 2 hours to construct Spanish sentences in my head about what I do, where did we learn Spanish, etc. There were 4 hours left for us to reach Marseille. We struck a good conversation and to our surprise, the lady knew Yogic concepts like Kundalini, breathing control and what not. She even demonstrated to us some Yoga postures. All this while, instructing her to dog to sit quiet. In return, I told her about my company, GE, back then, about how we made windmills (she filled in for our missing vocabulary), jet engines and the likes. She spoke slowly and corrected my grammar (I could never for the life of me keep in my head which object was feminine and which object was masculine). She appreciated our Argentinian accent and about how foreigners get the “R” wrong. She was taking her dog all the way from Colombia to her daughter in Montpellier in France, so that she has some company there. The things mothers do for their daughters. I enquired about her country and told her about the image we have of Colombia through Hollywood. She was unhappy the way natural resources in her country were depleted for all the wrong motives.
Then came the time for us to say good bye. She grabbed the dog in one hand, whisked away her big backpack and turned around to bid us farewell. “Good bye, Thanks for all the help and support and the amazing company you guys gave me” in pure, unadulterated English, were her parting words.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
My friend from the US was visiting our lab. This was John’s first trip outside of the US of A. He had a highly successful project running for years with distributed teams in China and India. He had not met any of them and wanted to visit the teams and catch a glimpse of the world outside of USA. He visited the team in China before he screeched his way to India.
</p>

<p>
I had finished my appraisal, so there wasn’t much work for a scientist after he finished writing his yearly appraisal. We would all wait for our next year’s funding to arrive before we could start work on our project. Consider it a scientist’s “bench” time, a corporate scientist, that is. Since, I had a lot of time at hand, I put my hand up to take John around Bangalore, the moment my manager put the task up for volunteers.
</p>


<p>
A Ford Ikon with full blast A/C was commanded for the foreign visitor. John turned out to be an atypical American tourist, atleast contrary to my expectations. He stopped to eat panipuris, cut fruits were fine with him and he drank “tap water”. The pseudo-American in me had stomach cramps just seeing all this unfold in front of my eyes. I asked him about his kids, his trip to Shanghai and everything under the sun.
He didn’t take out a camera and did not stare at cows crossing the street. My eyebrows were permanently raised throughout the sightseeing trip. The pinnacle came in Brigade Road. For those of you, who don’t know about Brigade Road, think of the most crowded road in the world, which has a ton of cars moving and multiply it by a factor of 2. (Chennaites, Ranganathan Street doesnot have cars going thru it :-p). There is very little respite for pedestrians, since either the cars are busy parking or zipping past the Road. I happened to be a very careful road-crosser, even if it is jaywalking, do it carefully. I was looking left, right, centre and took my own sweet time to analyze road conditions. I looked to my left to check if John had his eyes closed to avoid looking at the horrific traffic on road. To my shock, I couldn’t find John. I looked left, right, nope, not there. No mobiles with me either. I heard a faint call “Yo Bala! over here!”. I looked straight ahead in the direction of where the voice came from. John had already crossed the road.
Another 3 minutes later, I joined him across the road, still with my eyebrows stuck where they were. I couldn’t explain this one, so the scientist in me took control of me and grilled him. “John, you are supposed to be an American. You are supposed to be afraid of Indian traffic and totally inadept at crossing Indian roads. Please, please explain”. John patiently explained to me. “I was in Shanghai before coming to Bangalore. I was terrified of crossing the road, waiting for the opportune moment to cross the road. My hostess had crossed, seeing me, she crossed the road one more time to come up to me. She explained that to cross a road in Shanghai, the first step is to let go of the curb. The traffic shapes around you and you move to your destination. So, I assumed Bangalore is no different from Shanghai and crossed the road without a problem”.
</p>

<p>
That hit me so hard. “Let go of the curb” – as simple as that. To reach one’s goal, one had to let go off the current situation so that one can embark on to something new. I was waiting for opportunities to come to me, while all I needed to do was to just let go. So here I am in the free world, having let go of my material “scienticisms”. The world shaped around me to accommodate me. John, wherever you are, I’ll remember you for this high spiritual advice.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
I came across this wonderful personal productivity software called smthngs. What struck me as something very exotic is the minimalist design. Black and white and as promised, no manual needed to work with the software.
</p>

<p>
This software is based on getting things done (GTD) principles. Smthngs has most of the features that other websites like remember the milk (rmilk.com).
</p>


<p>
Some common features between RTM and smthngs are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>tags</li>
<li>clean interface</li>
<li>archiving completed tasks</li>
</ol>

<p>
Where Smthngs really scores:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Conversion of tasks into projects and vice-versa at a click of a button</li>
<li>Sub projects, sub-sub projects</li>
<li>User interface is cuter when you choose to have sub projects</li>
<li>Next Action, Someday, today tabs</li>
<li>All on one screen</li>
<li>Online, offline switch automatically</li>
<li>tag explorer is also nice</li>
<li>Drag and drop for anything imaginable, very intuitive.</li>
<li>Location feature works (can detect location well)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Remember the milk has these features which can be the wish list for Smthngs
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Twitter, email, google calendar, gmail addons</li>
<li>Mobile web interface</li>
<li>Works on all standard browsers</li>
<li>Fun stuff like Bob T Monkey and name like Remember the Milk (Its a cult, c’mon)</li>
<li>Email, twitter, mobile reminders</li>
<li>iPhone, blackberry, iPad apps (well, Pro version has this but, it is there never the same)</li>
<li>Chrome extension (Chrome app exists for Smthngs)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overall, Smthngs has a few vowels missing and a few features that can be added, but I am in love with the version they have right now. Do tell me if you have used RTM and are itching to try Smthngs or the other way round. I would like to hear your views.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
I hit upon a key insight when I replied to a mail after a recent community session. The session was on how to attain high productivity in life and work. This is the <a href="http://rahulbijlani.com/essays/you-are-not-running-out-of-time-essay/">link</a> of an article on how one never runs short of time, if one has the purpose figured out. In there was an anecdote from “Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance”.
</p>


<p>
“Eventually, I came across a thought from ‘Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance’. In the story, Pirsig, a young man, goes mountain-climbing with some elderly monks. He struggles throughout, and eventually gives up, while the monks easily continue to the peak. What is apparent is that Pirsig, focussed as he is on the peak, is overwhelmed by the climb, and continues to lose his desire and strength with every step. The monks, on the other hand, used the peak only as a guide to mark the direction of their climb; they were more focused on the journey and its enjoyment, and made it to the top with ease.” This is from the essay given in the link above.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the message is about “being in the moment” than lost in worry. Now, I thought about how else could Pirsig have made his journey better. Bing! Then it dawned on me that all Pirsig had to was to visualize himself standing on the peak. Or better still, carried a picture of the peak (Printed off the internet using Google Street View or from the myriads of pictures that enthusiastic tourists upload :)). The key is to move the concern from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the visual cortex of the brain. So how does that help? PFC is the last evolved portion of the human brain and hence is very low in energy efficiency. Any thoughts in this portion of the brain can be a drag on the brain’s resources. Visual cortex, however, has it all figured out and can handle any number of images. Once, the thought/concern moves to the visual cortex, PFC is free to enjoy the present moment.
</p>



<p>
What to do when a concern/worry hits you:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>write it down on a piece of paper</li>

<li>Close your eyes and imagine yourself having completely solved the problem</li>

<li>open your eyes and focus on what to do to alleviate the worry</li>
</ol>

<p>
In TRIZ toolkit, ideal final result (IFR) is about imagining a future where there is only good stuff or benefits. Now, one can add a visual to this IFR and get down to solving problems which are preventing one from getting to an IFR.
